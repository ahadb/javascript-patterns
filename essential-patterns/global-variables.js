/* Note: It is impossible to avoid global JavaScript, something will always be dangling in the
 * global scope. There are many approaches however, from simple to more complex, to not abuse
 * global scope - after reading through this section you should already start understanding
 * the power of patterns :/
 *
 * We'll explore more patterns that minimize globals in classes, and modules
 */

/* (i.) Always declare using an identifier your variables, if you don't it will clutter the global scope */
const foo = Math.PI;
const bar = [];
var quux = new Wizardry();
let i;
delete foo; //=> returns `false`

// anti-pattern
foo = Math.PI;
bar = [];
window.x = 10;
delete foo; //=> returns `true`

/* (ii.) It's very important to declare your variables, even in functions */
(function() {
  const norf = 'Laser Tag!';
  console.log(norf);  //=> `Laser Tag!`
})();

console.log(norf);  //=> undefined

// if you don't, they become global variables.
(function() {
  norf = 'Laser Tag!';
  console.log(norf);  //=> `Laser Tag!`
})();

console.log(norf);  //=> `Laser Tag` *whoops*

// in ES6, you can use an immediately invoked arrow function as well
(() => {
  const norf = 'Laser Tag!';
  console.log(norf);  //=> `Laser Tag!`
})();

console.log(norf);  //=> undefined

/* (iii.) When global variables sneak into your code the can cause problems. */
var count = function() {
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    console.log(i);
  }
};

count();  //=> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

var countSilently = function() {
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    // don't print anything;
  }
};

// both loops increment i at the same time, which causes strange behavior.
window.setTimeout(countSilently, 10);
window.setTimeout(count,         10);  //=> 2 3 7 8 9

/* (iv.) You can use 'this' in method definitions to refer to attributes of the
 * method's object.
 */
var obj = {
  name: 'quux',
  getName: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

obj.getName();  //=> `quux`

// But 'this' does not follow the normal rules of scope in JavaScript.
var obj = {
  name: 'quux',
  getName: function() {
    window.setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(this.name);
    }, 3000);
  }
};

obj.getName(); //=> undefined *whoops*

// In fact, this got bound to the global object in the callback.
// To get around this, we use `that`, `self`, or whatever you decide
var obj = {
  name: 'quux',
  getName: function() {
    var that = this;
    window.setTimeout(function() {
      print(that.name);
    }, 3000);
  }
};

obj.getName();  //=> `quux`

/* (v.) The keyword `this` is dynamically assigned at the callsite of a function.
 * When a function is invoked as a method, i.e. obj.method(), 'this'
 * is bound to 'obj'. But when a function is invoked by itself 'this' is bound
 * to the global object.
 */
var life = 'I love me some JavaScript!';

function meaning() {
  var life = 'Life in a function called meaning';
  console.log(this.life)
}

// This is true even of functions that were defined as a method.
var obj = {
  name: 'quux',
  getName: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

// When the function is invoked without 'obj.' in front of it, 'this' becomes
// the global namespace.
var getName = obj.getName;
getName();  //=> undefined

// wanted to scratch the surface with the `this` keyword, tbd in later patterns

/* (vi.) Recap: to avoid or help prevent the use of globals in your applications you can use
 * the following patterns popular amongst JavaScript developers
 */

// a. generally you can use a closure in both ES5 & ES6
function fullName(firstName, lastName) {
  let intro = "Your name is ";
  // this inner function has access to the outer function's variables, including the parameterâ€‹
  function makeFullName () {
    // intro is available here
    return intro + firstName + " " + lastName;
  }
  return makeFullName ();
}

console.log(intro); //=> undefined

// b. use an IIFE or IIAF as described above in (ii.)

// c: use the module pattern
const myModule = function () {

  // private variable(s)
  const myPrivateVar = "I am private, and can be accessed only from within the closure.";

  // private method(s):
  const myPrivateMethod = function () {
    console.log("I am private, and can be accessed only from within the closure.");
  };

  return  {
    myPublicProperty: "I'm accessible as myModule.myPublicProperty",
    myPublicMethod: function () {
      console.log("I'm accessible as myModule.myPublicMethod.");

      // Within myModule, I can access "private" vars and methods:
      console.log(myPrivateVar);
      console.log(myPrivateMethod());

      // The native scope of myPublicMethod is myModule; we can
      // access public members using "this":
      console.log(this.myPublicProperty);
    }
  };
}();

// d: The easiest way however is to wrap your code in a closure and manually expose those
// variables you need globally

(function() {
  // Your code here
  const foo = 1;
  const baz = 2;
  let quux = 'OOP';

  // Expose to global
  window['foo'] = foo;
})();

console.log(foo); //=> 1 *voila!*
