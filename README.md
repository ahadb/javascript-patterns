# javascript-patterns
An extensive list of everyday modern JavaScript patterns with syntactical examples in both ES5 and ES6.

## Introduction
This repository is a place for everyone (beginners to advanced) to come to, view and familiarize themselves with modern everyday patterns in vanilla JavaScript - you'll see alot of these examples in the wild, so in a sense you could call them _universal_ and that's a **good** thing. We will cover topics ranging from general to advanced, inclusive of design patterns and module creation patterns as well. Also note that both ES5 & ES6 syntax will be included in most of the code samples.

## Future of This Project
In future releases we will also cover Angular(1.x, 2.x), Node and React patterns. The formula for adding patterns will be determined by libraries / frameworks that hold the most market value. Once this repository contains enough information it will be converted into full blown application. The aim of crafting an application will be for users to view examples quickly so that within 2-3 minutes one can cover a great deal which might add to your programming skill in shorter bursts. I prefer shorter bursts of contextual learning over longer periods.
