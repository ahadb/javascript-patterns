# JavaScript Patterns
An extensive list of everyday modern JavaScript design and coding patterns (patterns in general, not just design patterns) with syntactical examples in both ES5 and ES6.

## Introduction
This repository is a place for pragmatic javascript developers (beginners to advanced) to view and familiarize themselves with modern
everyday patterns and idioms in vanilla style ES5 & ES6. It is important to define patterns that help us write better code and communicate with each other as developers, managers amd within groups & teams.

Listed within this repository will be the following types of patterns:
 * Code Patterns
 * Design Patterns
 * Modern Patterns

...note that the work here has been identified by the JavaScript community as well as within the authors own work. Thanks should be given to the developers, early adopters and JavaScript technocrats that came before us outlining important and oftern misunderstood concepts.

## Future of This Project
In future releases we will also cover Angular (2.x) and React patterns. The formula for adding patterns will be determined
by libraries / frameworks that hold the most market value. Once this repository contains enough information I'd like it to be converted into
a full blown application so developers can cover a great deal and retain information in short, but more meaningful bursts.

Perhaps I'll even publish it as a book, who knows - the future sees now boundaries.
