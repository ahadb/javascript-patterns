# javascript-patterns
An extensive list of everyday modern JavaScript patterns with syntactical examples in both ES5 and ES6.

## Introduction
This repository is a place for everyone (beginners to advanced) to view and familiarize themselves with modern everyday patterns in vanilla JavaScript - you'll see alot of these examples in the wild, so in a sense you could call them _universal_ and that's a **good** thing. We will cover topics ranging from general to advanced, while preferring modern ES6 syntax.

## Future of This Project
In future releases we will also cover Angular (1.x, 2.x), Node and React patterns. The formula for adding patterns will be determined by libraries / frameworks that hold the most market value. Once this repository contains enough information it will be converted into a full blown application so developers can cover a great deal and retain information in shorter but more meaningful bursts.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this repository by sending a PR for a specific pattern that you would like to see added. A guide will be put up shortly.
