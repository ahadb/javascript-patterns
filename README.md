# javascript-patterns
An extensive list of everyday modern JavaScript patterns with syntactical examples 

## Introduction
This repository is a place for everyone (beginners to advanced) to come to, view and familiarize themselves with modern everyday patterns in vanilla JavaScript. It will cover topics ranging from general to advanced as well as design patterns. In future releases we will also cover Angular(1,2), Node and React patterns - how that is composed in one repo is yet to be determined.

Note that I will try and cover both ES5 & ES6 syntax in most of the examples and once this repository contains enough information it will be converted into full blown application of my choice. The aim of crafting an application will be for users to view examples quickly so that within 2-3 minutes you can cover alot.
