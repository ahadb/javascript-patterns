/* (i). JavaScript introduced classes with the release of ES6 and is syntatical sugar over the

 * syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.

// a. Classes are just syntactical sugar
class Foo {}
typeof Foo;
// => 'Function'

// b. You can also only invoke a class with `new`
Foo();
// => TypeError: Classes canâ€™t be function-called

const f = new Foo();

/* (ii). There are two types of ways to define a Class in JavaScript - a. Class Declarations and b.
 * Class Expressions
